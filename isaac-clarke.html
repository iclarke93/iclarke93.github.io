     <p>Why the LIS program?</p>
     <blockquote>When I was growing up, one of my favorite people was the reference librarian at my local library and although I personally want to be an archivist, she was the reason I loved the library as much as I did (and still do) and made me want to become a librarian so that I could help people as much as she helped me.</blockquote>
